# Practice with Socket Programming

In this assignment, you will code a group chat room. In this chat room, clients connect to a remote server with a designated IP and port number. The server accepts connections from an arbitrary number of clients. Any message sent from one client is broadcast to all other clients. You must leverage the concepts of socket programming and multi-threading to achieve this task. Also, create a GUI for your chat room.

## Remember 

Use the concepts of socket programming and multi-threading.
